                    <p>
                        Web development is the dynamic and ever-evolving process of creating websites and web
                        applications that are accessible and interactive on the internet. It encompasses a wide
                        range of skills and technologies, including front-end development, which deals with the
                        user interface and user experience, and back-end development, which involves server-side
                        logic and database management.

                    <p>
                        App development, also known as mobile application development, is the process of creating
                        software applications specifically designed to run on mobile devices such as smartphones
                        and tablets. It involves a series of steps, including conceptualization, design, coding,
                        testing, and deployment. App developers use various programming languages like Java or
                        Kotlin for Android apps, Swift or Objective-C for iOS apps.
